If you're using a similar device, you can adjust your settings as follows to receive notifications:
   - Navigate to `Settings` > `Notifications` > `App settings`.
   - From the dropdown menu, select `All apps`.
   - Locate and select `Vacation Planner`, then toggle notifications on.

Additionally, you can view past notifications by enabling 'Notification History':

- Toggle on `Use Notification History`.

By accessing the notification history, you can modify settings for applications notifications, including whether they pop-up on the screen. Find a past notification from the Vacation Planner app press the arrow down and click on the notification.
